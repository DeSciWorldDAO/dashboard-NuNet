"description":"NuNet is a lightweight peer-to-peer platform that enables the connection of various devices and AI/ML agents in a secure and decentralized manner. The core platform is open source and is free for anyone to use. We are building a globally decentralized computing framework that combines latent computing power of independently owned compute devices across the globe into a dynamic marketplace of compute resources, individually rewarded via a tokenomic ecosystem based on NuNet Utility Token (NTX).
